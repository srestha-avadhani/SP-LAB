Question 2:
c) There are two different impulse responses possible for the given filter depending on the ROC we choose.impz() return the impulse response of the filter which has the ROC |z|>|pole|. This is an IIR filter as the frequency response extend infinitely in both directions.

d) As p value changes from positive to negative the it changes from a high pass filter to a low pass filter.The impulse response has oscillations for positive p values but when it becomes negative then it becomes a decreasing exponential.

e) We get the magnitude of impulse response to be constant for this system. We may assume this as a High pass filter. 




Question 3:

a) Poles are located at (r*cos(theta)+r*sin(theta),r*cos(theta)-r*sin(theta)).Zeros are located at (cos(theta)+sin(theta),cos(theta)-sin(theta))

b) Yes the system can be both stable and Causal at same time .Then the roc is |z|>r. Here r belongs to (0,1). So we can always have the ROC 1<|z|< inf for any value of theta and r< 2^-1/2.

c) For a fixed r (here r=0.95) when we keep modifying theta, the magnitude of the impulse response is constant everywhere (around ~1.05) but as theta tends to the value chosen , the magnitude becomes 0.

So if we plot the graphs for theta from 0 to pi , the value where the magnitude is 0 also moves along with theta chosen from 0 to pi

d) For a fixed theta (here theta = pi/3) when we keep modifying r, the magnitude of the graph tends to 1 (decreases from around as we increase r) while the function becomes 0 when phase = pi/3 .

Question 4:
a) we expect 6 poles because the plot has 6 peaks
b)The rough sketch is similar to the pole-zero plot we obtained.
