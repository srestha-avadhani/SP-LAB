LAB THEORY -10

Question - 10.1

b) None of these filters phases are linear as they are IIR filers


c)It depends on the purpose of usage of filters. One can infer based on these factors:
1) RESPONSE - The magnitude response of the butterworth filter decreases with increase in frequency , while the magnitude response of the Chebyshev filter fluctuates or show ripples.

2) TRANSITION BAND - Chebyshev filters have sharper frequency cut-off while butterworth filters have a wide transition band.

3) TIME DOMAIN - Butterworth filters have a better time domain as output is more stable (no peaking) while chebyshev filters have ringing in time domain due to ripples/peaks.


Question - 10.2

b)Yes this filter is  stable as its poles lies inside the unit circle.


c)As the r0 value decreases the magnitude response becomes broader and the peak value decreases.
